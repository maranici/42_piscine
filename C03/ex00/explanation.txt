In the function ft_strcmp, we compare the strings s1 and s2. 
While both s1 and s2 point to the same character, we increment the pointers. 
When the characters differ, we return the difference between the ASCII values of the characters pointed to by s1 and s2. 
This difference is cast to int to ensure correct comparison results.
