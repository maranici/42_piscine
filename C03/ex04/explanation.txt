The ft_strstr function searches for the first occurrence of the substring to_find within the string str.

    If to_find is an empty string, the function immediately returns str.
    The function iterates through str using an index i.
    For each position in str, it compares the substring starting from str[i] with to_find character by character using another index j.
    If the characters match, it keeps track of the starting position with a pointer ptr.
    If the entire to_find string is found within str, it returns the pointer ptr to the first occurrence.
    If no match is found, the function returns 0.

This function effectively implements a simple substring search.
