#include "unistd.h":

    This line includes the unistd.h header file, which provides access to the POSIX operating system API, including the write function used in this code.

void ft_print_alphabet(void):

    This defines a function named ft_print_alphabet that takes no parameters.
    The void keyword in the parameter list indicates that the function does not take any arguments.
    The void keyword before the function name indicates that the function does not return any value.

char c;:

    This declares a variable c of type char. This variable will be used to hold and print each character of the alphabet.

c = 'a';:

    This initializes the variable c with the character 'a', the starting character of the alphabet.

while (c <= 'z'):

    This begins a while loop that will continue to execute as long as c is less than or equal to 'z', the last character of the alphabet.
    Inside the loop:
        write(1, &c, 1);:
            The write function is called to output the character c.
            1 is the file descriptor for standard output (stdout), meaning the character will be written to the terminal.
            &c is the address of the character c. This is necessary because write expects a pointer to the data to be written.
            The last 1 specifies the number of bytes to write, which in this case is one byte (the size of a char).
        c++;:
            This increments the character c to the next character in the ASCII sequence.
