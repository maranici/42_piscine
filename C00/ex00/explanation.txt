#include "unistd.h":

    This line includes the unistd.h header file, which provides access to the POSIX operating system API, including the write function used in this code.

void ft_putchar(char c):

    This defines a function named ft_putchar that takes a single parameter, c, of type char.
    The void keyword indicates that this function does not return any value.

write(1, &c, 1);:

    The write function is called to output the character c.
    1 is the file descriptor for standard output (stdout), meaning the character will be written to the terminal.
    &c is the address of the character c. This is necessary because write expects a pointer to the data to be written.
    The last 1 specifies the number of bytes to write, which in this case is one byte (the size of a char).
